 *
 * What the recorder *does* on each demo page once it is open.
 *
 * The registry lives here rather than in `core/` on purpose: adding or removing
 * a page must never mean editing frozen code. A page with no entry falls back
 * to `runStandardAction` — type the prompt, submit, wait for the reply — which
 * is right for most pages. Write a handler only when a page needs more than
 * that: switching tabs, clicking an approval button, opening a panel.
 *
 * Handlers should build on the helpers in `core/actions.ts`:
 *
 *   sendPrompt(page, prompt, opts)          types and submits, returns the
 *                                           assistant-message count from before
 *                                           submitting
 *   waitForAgentResponseCompletion(...)     waits for the reply to finish, and
 *                                           throws AgentSilentError if none
 *                                           ever arrives
 *   promptsFor(config)                      the page's prompts[], or [prompt]
 *
 * Pass that returned count into waitForAgentResponseCompletion on multi-turn
 * pages, or the previous turn's reply is mistaken for this one's.
 *
 * The fourth argument, `ctx`, is how a handler reports what it saw:
 *
 *   ctx.warn('the documented defect did not reproduce')  -> [PASS*]/[ISSUE] with the note
 *   ctx.fail('Approve button never rendered')             -> [FAIL], clip still saved
 *
 * A `console.warn` reaches nobody: the summary, RECORD_RESULTS.json and the
 * daily report only see what goes through `ctx`.
 *
 * ── The four issue handlers ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `a2ui`, `voice-multimodal`, `threads` and `memory` carry a `knownIssue` in
 * pages.config.ts and their handlers exist to make the defect *visible*: an
 * absence looks identical to a slow page on video unless something on screen
 * says otherwise. Each ends by jotting a short informal note with
 * `writeScratchNote` -- the formal KnownIssue still goes to the report via
 * `ci/build-report.mjs`, but a person mid-test does not type finished prose,
 * so the two were deliberately decoupled. See `actions/scratch-note.ts`.
 *
 * They also all tolerate agent silence rather than letting it abort the take —
 * whether the agent additionally failed to answer is not the finding, and
 * losing the evidence to an exception would throw away the point of the clip.
